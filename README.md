# University Class Scheduling System using Genetic Algorithms

This project automates university class scheduling using a genetic algorithm. It addresses the challenges of creating efficient timetables by considering constraints such as room capacity, instructor availability, and meeting times.

## Features

- **Data Management**: Stores information about rooms, meeting times, instructors, courses, and departments.
- **Constraint Handling**: Ensures schedules respect room capacity, instructor availability, and course requirements.
- **Efficient Scheduling**: Generates optimized class schedules using genetic algorithm principles.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-scheduler.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python scheduler.py
    ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Provide initial data for rooms, instructors, courses, and departments.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: The system uses genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve schedules.
3. **Output**: The algorithm outputs an optimized schedule that satisfies the given constraints.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier data input and schedule visualization.
- Enhance algorithm performance for larger datasets.
- Integrate additional constraints such as preferred meeting times.
